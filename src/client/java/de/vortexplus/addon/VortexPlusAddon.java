/**
 * Vortex Plus -- extra combat modules for Vortex Client.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS VERSION, AND WHY:
 *
 * The modules used to be pushed straight into the client's internal list, and a
 * category was forced into its enum at runtime using sun.misc.Unsafe -- roughly
 * a hundred lines of the most dangerous technique Java has, where a mistake
 * gives you memory corruption rather than an error message.
 *
 * None of that is needed. The client has had a Cheats category since 2.5.0 and
 * a public way to add modules, so this now asks properly instead of reaching
 * inside. A hundred lines of risk replaced by one word.
