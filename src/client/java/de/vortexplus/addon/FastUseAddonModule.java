/**
 * Throws faster by removing the client's own pause.
 *
 * HOW THIS WORKS NOW, AND WHY THE LAST VERSION MISBEHAVED:
 *
 * After each use the client waits four ticks before sending another. That pause
 * lives on your machine alone; the server neither knows nor enforces it.
 *
 * The previous version tried to get around it by sending extra "use item"
 * messages itself. The server took some and discarded the rest, and what you
 * saw were ghost items -- a handful thrown, then most of them back in your
 * hand. Nothing was really thrown; the client had simply told itself a story
 * the server never agreed to.
 *
 * This version sends nothing of its own. It sets the pause to zero and lets the
 * game do the using, exactly as it would if you were clicking. Every throw goes
 * through the normal path in the normal order, so there is nothing to take back.
 *
 * ON FOOD: eating is not repeated tapping, it is one long hold. There is no
 * pause to remove, and hurrying it is not something the client can decide --
 * the server times the eating and hands you the effect at the end. That is why
 * golden apples never sped up, and why this no longer pretends otherwise.
